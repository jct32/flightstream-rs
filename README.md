# flightstream_rs
A plugin designed to import flight plans from SimBrief into the laminiar X1000 or X530 whichever one is the primary GPS for the plane.

# How to Use
Inside the package is a username.txt file. Just insert your simbrief username into that file and then you can load the flight plan from the flightstream_rs menu in X-Plane.

If you want to change the username while X-Plane is already loaded, you can change the file and then choose the Set username from the flightstream_rs menu.
